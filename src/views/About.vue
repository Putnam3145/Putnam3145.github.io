    Hi, I'm Putnam. I've got 8 years of programming under my belt, all of it for open source projects. I'm not exactly known, but whenever I show up to a community that needs programmers, I've historically turned heads: people take notice of me and my skill.<br><br>
    All this bragaddocio is to say that, actually, by the software industry's reckoning, I have literally 0 experience and no degree. I have never been paid money for my programming work, which makes all of it objectively valueless, if you consider the only objective measurement of value to be payment. In order to rectify this, I would greatly appreciate a bit of money sent my way, so as to show the industry that maybe my skills are worth being paid for. Also, because I have to eat.
