    Hi, I'm Putnam. I've got 8 years of programming under my belt, all of it for open source projects. I'm not exactly known, but whenever I show up to a community that needs programmers, I've historically turned heads: people take notice of me and my skill.<br><br>
    All this bragaddocio is to say that, since I live in the middle of nowhere and have no experience I've actually been <i>paid</i> for, all of this experience means nothing, as I have no meaningful connections to prove to anyone that I have experience with value. So, e-begging is my only real means for income. Whoops!
